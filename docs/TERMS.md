## POD

A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more
application containers (such as Docker), and some shared resources for those
containers. Those resources include:

* Shared storage, as Volumes.
* Networking, as a unique cluster IP address.
* Information about how to run each container, such as the container image
  version or specific ports to use.

## Node

A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a
physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each Node is managed by the
Master. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes master
automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the cluster.
The Master's automatic scheduling takes into account the available resources
on each Node. 

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:

* Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes
  Master and the Node; it manages the Pods and the containers running on a
  machine.
* A container runtime (like Docker) responsible for pulling the container image
  from a registry, unpacking the container, and running the application.

## Service

A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods
and a policy by which to access them. They provide load balancing, naming,
and discovery to isolate one microservice from another. Services enable a
loose coupling between dependent Pods. A Service is defined using YAML
(preferred) or JSON, like all Kubernetes objects. The set of Pods targeted by
a Service is usually determined by a LabelSelector (see below for why you
might want a Service without including selector in the spec).

Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs are not exposed outside
the cluster without a Service. Services allow your applications to receive
traffic. Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a type in
the ServiceSpec:

## Replica Sets

A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at
any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a
specified number of identical Pods.

## Namespaces

Namespaces provide isolation and access control, so that each microservice can
control the degree to which other services interact with it.

## Ingress Objects

Ingress objects provide an easy-to-use frontend that can combine multiple micro‚Äê
services into a single externalized API surface area.
